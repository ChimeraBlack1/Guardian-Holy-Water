				<h3 className="H3">The "Triple Holiness" technique.</h3>
				<p className="tripHoly">The water comes from a spring high in thte andes mountains.  It is harvested by a blind priest who brings it down to his village where it sits in a barrel
Inside a church for 10 years.  From there it is shipped to Israel where it is blessed by a deaf priest.  Once he has blessed the water it is then shipped
to the Vatican to be blessed by the Pope.  At this stage the tears of a virgin alter boy are added and it is shipped here to Canada for one final blessing.
Once it is in our Canadian warehouse, our very own mute Priest places the final blessing upon the barrel.  We know it’s ready when it gives off a glow
that you can only see if you look very closely and believe in the power of almighty god.</p>
